# Streamlit CSV Query App

This Streamlit app enables users to upload a CSV file and perform queries on the data within the file. It provides a simple interface for querying data using pandas' DataFrame querying capabilities.

# CSV File Upload:

Users can upload a CSV file by selecting it through the file uploader component.
The uploaded file is then read into a pandas DataFrame for further processing.

# Query Section:

In the query section, users can input their query using a text input field.
Users can input any valid pandas query expression, such as filtering rows based on conditions or selecting specific columns.
Query Execution and Result Display:

Upon submitting the query, the app attempts to execute it on the DataFrame.
If the query is valid and successfully executed, the resulting DataFrame is displayed below the query input field.
If an error occurs during query execution, the app displays an error message indicating the nature of the error.
Usage:

Users can upload a CSV file containing their data.
They can input queries into the provided text input field using pandas query syntax.
After submitting the query, the app displays the results of the query if it's successful.
Users can refine their queries as needed and observe the results in real-time.

# Dependencies:

The app relies on Streamlit and Pandas libraries. Ensure these dependencies are installed before running the app.

# Note:

Users should be familiar with pandas query syntax to effectively use this app.
The app provides a convenient way to interactively explore and query data within a CSV file.
